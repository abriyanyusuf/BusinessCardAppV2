This is the respository of the final project of the pathway 3 Android Basics with Compose class. This project was created by following the existing guidelines, where I used Icons available at [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/icons) and followed the usage guidelines in the [Icons](https://developer.android.com/reference/kotlin/androidx/compose/material/icons/Icons) documentation.

By default, Jetpack Compose comes with a limited set of icons. Add the following dependency in the app-level gradle file to get all the material icons.

`// material icons
implementation "androidx.compose.material:material-icons-extended"`

Here are some tutorials and resources that I used as references and materials to complete this project:

1. [How to Use Icons in Jetpack Compose?](https://semicolonspace.com/jetpack-compose-icons/)

2. [Jetpack Compose Alignment and Arrangement (with Examples)](https://semicolonspace.com/jetpack-compose-alignment-arrangement/)
